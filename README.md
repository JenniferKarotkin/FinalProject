# FinalProject
A simple quiz application that tells the user if they are a type a person or type b person.  The user will click on question 1, 2, or 3 and it will take them to a separate view controller that will ask them a question.  Their response will be recorded by clicking the switch provided, and that answer will be brought back to the main start view controller.  Then, once the user is finished answering all 3 questions, they will click "go" to bring them to the results page.  If they got mostly A's, they are a type a person and vice versa.  They will use the picker below with their results and information from a json file will appear in the text view box.
